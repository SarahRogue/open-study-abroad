# Travelling through Intersections

## Welcome! 
Welcome to the Travelling Intersections website, and thank you for visiting us. We hope you will have a pleasant and meaningful journey with us... Actually, we need your help. We recognize that we all face different challenges in terms of studying abroad and for resources to be helpful it needs to be inclusive and applicable. By contributing to this resource, you will just do that! 

## Vision
I am working with students and fellow colleagues at Stellenbosch University to develop open and inclusive study abroad resources so that we could achieve the goal of “inclusive internationalization” and make studying abroad more accessible.   I am also hoping to work with colleagues at other South African Universities. 
I am working open (with students and colleagues), to ensure that we have the buy-in of the respective stakeholders and that the material represents the perspectives of the different stakeholders and campuses.  

## Background Information
For an introduction to the idea of "inclusive internationalization", please refer to [The ABC guide to inclusive international mobility for all](https://www.eaie.org/our-resources/library/publication/Tools-Templates/abc-guide-inclusive-international-mobility.html). The latter resource was developed by the European Association for International Education (EAIE). 

An important reference point for this project is the [Nelson Mandela Bay Global Dialogue Declaration on the Future of Internationalisation of Higher Education](https://www.eaie.org/community/projects-advocacy/global-dialogue-declaration.html). For more information about the declaration please refer to this [article](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20140118132339578)  on University World News. 

## Dialectic between Intersectionality and Inclusive Internationalization:
It is important to think about what makes an activity open and inclusive. To help us conceptualize and actualize this, we recognize the importance of intersectionality to better understand the world we live in. In this regard intersectionality is an important analytical/critical tool for us.
