# Intersectionality and Studying Abroad

Thinking about intersectionality should not be limited to just one aspect of the study abroad life cycle. That being said, we need to consider how thinking about intersectionality can have a direct impact on our students and how they view their study abroad experiences. For this reason it is very important to focus on two stages of the Study Abroad Life Cycle: Pre-departure and return to campus.  With both of these stages, one can implement activities that have a direct impact on students’ personal reflections. 

These activities would do two things:

**Stimulate self-reflexivity 
**Create a social justice awareness with students
