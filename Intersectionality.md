# Intersectionality and Studying Abroad

Thinking about intersectionality should not be limited to just one aspect of the study abroad life cycle. That being said, we need to consider how thinking about intersectionality can have a direct impact on our students and how they view their study abroad experiences. For this reason it is very important to focus on two stages of the Study Abroad Life Cycle: Pre-departure and return to campus.  With both of these stages, one can implement activities that have a direct impact on students’ personal reflections and in so doing hopefully do the following:  

* Stimulate self-reflexivity 
* Create a social justice awareness with students

The above activities are however centered very much around students, and inclusive internationalization can’t only be attained by the acts of students - it is very much also an institutional project. That is why there should be an intersectional dialectic (??) between students and international education practitioners. Through their interaction with students, practitioners can identify those things that still fall short in terms of the internationalization processes of the respective institution. And in the process students and practitioners think together.
